# Base Mainnet Token Sale Example

This script deploys a token on Base Mainnet, deploys an Uniswap V2 liquidity pool with all the ETH balance in your wallet, and then returns the token address in the terminal. It uses Infura gas API to fetch the best fees to prevent transaction from being dropped.

Simply replace "SEED PHRASE HERE" with your seed phrase (wallet must have Base ETH) in hardhat.config.ts and then run:



```shell
yarn install
yarn run hardhat run scripts/dynamicfee.ts --network base
```

You will be asked questions like name, symbol, initialSupply and then after some waiting you will be given a token address. You can search for your pair on uniswap page.
